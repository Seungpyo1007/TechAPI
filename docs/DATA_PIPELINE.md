# Data pipeline: static dump, automation, and collection

This document explains how TechAPI moves from a database to a **static JSON
dataset**, how that dataset is **refreshed automatically**, how data is
**collected** from open sources, and the **public-vs-private** options for the
data itself. It complements SPEC §4.2 (data flow), §9 (collection), §16
(CI/CD), and ADR-003/005.

## 1. Why static?

Device specs change on a **release cadence**, not in real time — a weekly (or
daily) refresh is plenty. That makes a pre-generated static dataset ideal:

- **Cheap & reliable**: served as plain files from a CDN / GitHub Pages / raw
  URLs — no always-on server or database to operate or pay for.
- **Versioned**: every refresh is a Git commit, so the history *is* a free
  time-series of spec changes ("git scraping").
- **Fast**: edge-cached files, no cold starts.

### How others do it
- **PokeAPI** converted its API to **static JSON files** in 2018, generated
  from its database by an updater bot and hosted on cheap static hosting +
  Cloudflare CDN. See [PokeAPI/api-data](https://github.com/PokeAPI/api-data),
  [pokeapi.co/about](https://pokeapi.co/about).
- **Git scraping** (Simon Willison): a scheduled GitHub Actions job fetches
  data, pretty-prints it, and commits it back when it changes — no server
  needed. See [simonwillison.net](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/).

TechAPI already anticipated this: SPEC §4.2 (DB → static dump), §5.2
(`api-data` repo), §16.1 (`dump-data.yml`).

## 2. The dump generator (`scripts/dump.py`)

`python -m scripts.dump` seeds a database, then **replays the real API
endpoints through an in-process client** and writes each response to disk. The
static files therefore byte-match the live API (no serialization drift).

Output layout (under `dump/`):

```
dump/v1/index.json                              # manifest: collections + counts
dump/v1/smartphones/index.json                  # { count, results: [all refs] }
dump/v1/smartphones/galaxy-s25/index.json       # full detail (== GET /v1/smartphones/galaxy-s25)
dump/v1/smartphones/galaxy-s25/score/index.json # score sidecar
dump/v1/socs/…  /v1/gpus/…  /v1/cpus/…  /v1/brands/…
```

A static consumer just fetches, e.g.
`https://<host>/v1/smartphones/galaxy-s25/index.json`.

## 3. Automated refresh (`.github/workflows/refresh-data.yml`)

A scheduled workflow (weekly cron + on `data/**` changes + manual) runs:

```
validate seed data → generate dump → publish/commit dump if changed
```

This is the git-scraping pattern: GitHub runs and stores everything for free.
The hosting target depends on the public/private decision (§5).

## 4. Where the data comes from

This repo contains only **curated, validated** records. Bulk collection and
normalization happen **outside this repo**, through a separate internal pipeline,
which publishes curated records here (by PR) after review (SPEC §9.3). This repo
never needs scraping/browser dependencies.

**Dataset layout (this repo).** Curated data uses singular folder names and is
organised by brand: `data/brand/<slug>.json`, `data/soc/<manufacturer>/<slug>.json`,
`data/smartphone/<brand>/<slug>.json`, `data/gpu/<manufacturer>/<slug>.json`,
`data/cpu/<manufacturer>/<slug>.json`. (API routes stay plural, e.g. `/v1/socs`.)
The dataset is a **curated subset, not exhaustive.**

## 5. Public vs private data

The current SPEC positions data as **open** (CC-BY-SA 4.0, ADR-005) — that is
core to the "open data platform" identity (§1.6). Keeping data private is a
real option but is a **strategy change**, so here are the paths:

| Option | What it means | Trade-offs |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Public (current SPEC)** | `data/` + static dump public, CC-BY-SA | Simplest; matches open-data mission & PokeAPI model; community can contribute & self-host. Anyone can copy the data. |
| **B. Private factory → public product** | Scrapers + raw/messy data in a **private** repo; only a curated, licensed **public dump** is published | Best of both: keep collection methods/raw data private, still ship an open API. Two repos to run. |
| **C. Fully private** | Data + dump + API all private (private repo, auth-gated API) | Maximum control / proprietary value, but abandons the open-data positioning, CC-BY-SA, and community contributions. The API stays code-MIT but data is closed. |

**Recommendation:** **B** if the concern is protecting *collection effort /
raw scrape data* while still offering a public API; **C** only if the dataset
itself is meant to be a proprietary asset (then revisit ADR-005, §1.6, §10 and
the token model in §7.6). Either way the **code stays MIT**; what changes is
where `data/` lives and whether the dump is published publicly.

> Mechanically, private collection is easy: put `data/` and the collector in a
> **private** GitHub repo and run the same Actions there (private repos get
> free Actions minutes for personal accounts). For option B, that private repo
> publishes the curated dump to a separate public repo / Pages on each refresh.
